### Build Process
First approach to this project was pen, paper and design to create something unique. This would be the foundation for all portfolio pages going forth and thus I need to start really diving into CSS and how Javascript offers additional functionality. Method of attack was as follows
1. Create a background Animation
2. Hide project window thorugh `Display: None` and enable through `onClick`
3. Use `clip-path` to offer unique shapes for the CSS Grid used in Project Window
4. Use PhotoShop to replicate my bedroom. Take this image and apply as background for contact page
5. Add additional popups, hover and focus affects where possible

### Build Issues
As per usual learning CSS takes time and my intent was to make something that resembles an Manga page. Unfortunately do to time restraints I had to settle for the current version.
